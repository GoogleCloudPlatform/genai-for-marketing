# Environment Setup

This section outlines the steps to configure the Google Cloud environment that is required in order to run the notebooks and code provided in this repository.  
You will be interacting with the following resources:
 - A user-managed instance of Vertex AI Workbench serves as your development setting and the main interface to Vertex AI services.  
 - BigQuery is utilized to house data from Marketing Platforms, while Dataplex is employed to keep their metadata.  
 - Vertex AI Search & Conversation - are used to construct a search engine for an external website.  
 - Workspace (Google Slides, Google Docs and Google Sheets) are used to visualized the resources generated by you.


### Select a Google Cloud project

In the Google Cloud Console, on the project selector page, [select or create a Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2).  
> **As this is a DEMONSTRATION, you need to be a project owner in order to set up the environment.**


### Enable the required services

From [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-cloud-shell), run the following commands to enable the required Cloud APIs.  
Change `PROJECT_ID` to the id of your project.

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=<CHANGE TO YOUR PROJECT ID>
 
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

```

**Note**: When you work with Vertex AI user-managed notebooks, be sure that all the services that you're using are enabled.

### Configure Vertex AI Workbench

Create a user-managed notebooks instance from the command line.
 
**Note**: Make sure that you're following these steps in the same project as before.
 
In Cloud Shell, enter the following command.  
 - For `<CHANGE TO YOUR PROJECT ID>`, enter the ID of your project.  
 - For `<YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME>`, enter a name starting with a lower-case letter followed by lower-case letters, numbers or dash sign.  
 - For `<YOUR_LOCATION>`, add a zone (for example, `us-central1-a` or `europe-west4-a`).

```bash
PROJECT_ID=<CHANGE TO YOUR PROJECT ID>
INSTANCE_NAME=<YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME>
LOCATION=<YOUR_LOCATION>
gcloud notebooks instances create $INSTANCE_NAME \
     --vm-image-project=deeplearning-platform-release \
     --vm-image-family=common-cpu-notebooks \
     --machine-type=n1-standard-4 \
     --location=$LOCATION
```

Vertex AI Workbench creates a user-managed notebook instance based on the properties that you specified and then automatically starts the instance. When the instance is ready to use, Vertex AI Workbench activates an **Open JupyterLab** link next to the instance name in the [Vertex AI Workbench Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/user-managed) page. To connect to your user-managed notebooks instance, click **Open JupyterLab**.

On Jupyterlab `Launcher Page`, click on `Terminal` to start a new terminal.  
Clone the repository to your notebook instance:

> git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/genai-for-marketing

### Update the configuration with information of your project

Open the [configuration file](/app/override.toml) and include your project id (line 21) and location (line 22).

### Prepare BigQuery and Dataplex

Open notebook [`/genai-for-marketing/notebooks/1_environment_setup.ipynb`](/notebooks/1_environment_setup.ipynb) and follow the instructions in it.  
It will execute the following steps:
 - Install dependecies to run the notebook
 - Create a dataset on BigQuery
 - Create a synthetic CDP dataset and load it to BigQuery
 - Create Tag Template on Dataplex
 - Tag dataset columns with metadata
 - Test the deployment

Make sure all the steps are executed successfully and you can retrieve the metadata from Dataplex.  
The metadata should look like this:

```
Table: transactions - Column: app_purchase_qnt - Data Type: INT64 - Primary Key: False - Foreing Key: False - Description: The value of the in-app purchase.
...
Table: customers - Column: total_value - Data Type: INT64 - Primary Key: False - Foreing Key: False - Description: The total value of all purchases made by the customer.
```


### Create an Vertex AI Search engine for a public website

Follow the steps below to create a search engine for a website using Vertex AI Search.
 - Make sure the Vertex AI Search APIs are enabled [here](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/try-enterprise-search#before-you-begin) and you activated Vertex AI Search [here](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/try-enterprise-search#activate).
 - Create and preview the website search engine as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/try-enterprise-search#create_a_search_app_for_website_data) and [here](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/try-enterprise-search#preview_your_app_for_website_data).

After you finished creating the Vertex AI Search datastore, navigate back to the [`Apps`](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/engines) page and copy the ID of the datastore you just created.  
Example:  
![Vertex AI Search ID](./app/images/es_id.png)

Open this [configuration file - line 54](/app/override.toml) and include the datastore ID. To do that create a variable that follows this pattern:  
> datastores.<datastore ID> = "default_config".  
The resulting code should look like this:  

```
# Vertex AI Search datastores and location. 
# Change the dataset variable to reflect your configuration.
# Sample datastore ID
# datastores.<datastore ID> = 'default_config'
datastores.google-ads-support_1686058481432 = "default_config"
```

**Don't forget to save the configuration file.**


### Add your Looker Dashboards

In order to render your Looker Dashboards in the UI, you need to update a configuration file with the links to them.

Open the [configuration file](/app/override.toml) and include links to the Looker dashboards for:
* Marketing Insights (line ---)  
* Campaign Performance (line 99).  

The resulting code should look like this:  

```
# Looker Dashboards
# The link of the looker Dashboard must follow this format:
# https://<LOOKER INSTANCE URL>/embed/dashboards/<DASHBOARD NUMBER>?allow_login_screen=true
# Include your Dashboards following this patter:
# dashboards.<Name of your dashboard, no spaces> = '<link to your dashboard>'
dashboards.Overview = 'https://googledemo.looker.com/embed/dashboards/2131?allow_login_screen=true'
```

The `allow_login_screen=true` will open the authentication page from Looker to secure the access to your account.

**[Optional]** If you have your Google Ads and Google Analytics 4 accounts in production, you can deploy the [`Marketing Analytics Jumpstart`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketing-analytics-jumpstart) solution to your project, build the Dashboards and link them to the demonstration UI.  


### Create a Generative AI Agent

Next you will create a Generative AI Agent that will assist the users to answer questions about Google Ads, etc.
- Follow the steps described in this [Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/dialogflow-generator#0) to build your own Generative AI Agent.
  - Execute these steps in the same project you will deploy this demo.
  - In step 3 of this Codelab you can provide a different URL to be indexed by the Generative AI Agent, for example `support.google.com/google-ads/*`.
  - [Optional] Use LLMs to generate answers when no answer is found. If you have questions, please refer to this [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/generative-agent).
- Enable [Dialogflow Messenger integration](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration/dialogflow-messenger) and copy the HTML code snippet provided by the platform.  
  - The HTML code snippet looks like this: 
  ![HTML Code](/app/images/dialogflow-integration.png "HTML Code")
  - Open the [configuration file - line 79](/app/override.toml) and replace the HTML code snipped with the one created in your deployment.


### Workspace integration

Follow the steps below to setup the Workspace integration with this demonstration.


#### Create a service account
- Create a Service Account (SA) in the same project you are deploying the demo and download the JSON API Key. This SA doesn't need any roles / permissions.  
  - Follow this [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) to create the service account. Take note of the service account address; it will look like this: `name-of-the-sa@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
  - Follow this [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating) to download the key JSON file with the service account credentials.  
  - Rename the JSON file to `credentials.json` and copy it under [/app](/app) folder.
  - [Optional] If your file has a different name and/or you copied it to a different location, change line 23 in [override.toml](/app/override.toml) to reflect these changes.
 - When you deploy the app to AppEngine, the JSON file will be copied inside the docker image.
 - **IMPORTANT**: For security reasons, DON'T push this credentials to a public Github repository.


#### Change the DOMAIN that folders will be shared with
This demonstration will create folders under Google Drive, Google Docs documents, Google Slides presentations and Google Sheets documents.  
When we create the Drive folder, we set the permission to all users under a specific domain.

 - Open [override.toml - line 44](/app/override.toml) and change to the domain you want to share the folder (example: mydomain.com).
   - This is the same domain where you have Workspace set up.

Be aware that this configuration will share the folder with all the users in that domain.  
If you want to change that behavior, explore different ways of sharing resources from this documentation:  
https://developers.google.com/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/permissions#resource:-permission


#### Google Drive
 - Navigate to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and create a folder.  
   - This folder will be used to host the templates and assets created in the demo.
 - Share this folder with the service account address you created in the previous step. Give "Editor" rights to the service account. The share will look like this:
![Share Drive](/app/images/workspace-drive.png "Share Drive")
 - Take note of the folder ID. Go into the folder you created and you will be able to find the ID in the URL. The URL will look like this:
 ![Drive ID](/app/images/workspace-drive0.png)
 - Open the configuration file [override.toml - line 65](/app/override.toml) and change to your folder ID.
 - **IMPORTANT**: Also share this folder with people who will be using the code.


#### Google Slides, Google Docs and Google Sheets
 - Copy the content of [templates](/templates) to this newly created folder.
 - For the Google Slides template (`[template] Marketing Assets`): 
   - From the Google Drive folder open the file in Google Slides.  
   - In Google Slides, click on `File` and `Save as Google Slides`. Take note of the Slides ID from the URL.
   - Open the configuration file [override.toml - line 66](/app/override.toml) and change to your Slides ID.
 - For the Google Docs template (`[template] Gen AI for Marketing Google Doc Template`): 
   - From the Google Drive folder open the file in Google Docs. 
   - In Google Docs, click on `File` and `Save as Google Docs`. Take note of the Docs ID from the URL.
   - Open the configuration file [override.toml - line 67](/app/override.toml) and change to your Docs ID.
 - For the Google Sheets template (`[template] GenAI for Marketing`):  
   - From the Google Drive folder open the Google Sheets.
   - In Google Sheets, click in `File` and `Save as Google Sheets`. Take note of the Sheets ID from the URL.
   - Open the configuration file [override.toml - line 68](/app/override.toml) and change to your Sheets ID.
 

### Deploy the demonstration to App Engine

 - On Jupyterlab `Launcher Page` (in the Workbench managed instance), click on `Terminal` to start a new terminal by clicking the Terminal icon.  
 - Navigate to `genai-for-marketing` folder  

> cd genai-for-marketing

 - Open the [`app.yaml`](./app.yaml) configuration file and include your service account (Compute Engine default service account) in line 19:

 ```
 service_account: <REPLACE WITH YOUR SERVICE ACCOUNT ADDRESS>
 ```

The service account has the following format: `PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`

You can check the available service accounts in your project by running the following command:  
> gcloud iam service-accounts list

 - Deploy the solution to AppEngine

> gcloud app deploy

Wait for the application to be deployed and open the link generated by AppEngine.

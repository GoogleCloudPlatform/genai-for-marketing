This README is guidance for developers working on the frontend UI. See the root [README](../README.md) for information on deploying the solution (including the frontend).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.3.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve --port 5000` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

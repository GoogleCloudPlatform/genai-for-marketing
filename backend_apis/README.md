# GenAI for Marketing - Backend APIs

This information is developers working directly with the backend APIs. See the root [README](../README.md) for information on deploying the solution (including the backend).

We developed a comprehensive set of APIs, utilizing Python and FastAPI, which encapsulate all features available in the GenAI for Marketing repository. This implementation paves the way for streamlined data interactions and enhanced functionality, enabling you to deploy the solution in your environment.

You are empowered to extend these APIs, intertwining them with your specific policies pertaining to security, access, and authentication to bolster a secure, seamless, and individualized interaction with the data and services available. Our offering merges practicality with customization, ensuring that your specific requirements are catered to with precision and reliability.

## Firebase Setup
Connect your app to your Firebase project, do so from the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
 - Enable Email/Password sign-in:
 - In the Firebase console, open the Auth section.
 - On the Sign in method tab, enable the Email/password sign-in method and click Save
 - Add a Web App to project by going to Project Setting, it will generate the credentials.
 - Store credentialds in [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/create-secret-quickstart) and add secret_name in config.toml

## Workspace Integration

Follow the steps below to setup the Workspace integration with this demonstration.

### Create a Service Account
- Create a Service Account (SA) in the same project you are deploying the demo and download the JSON API Key. This SA doesn't need any roles / permissions.  
  - Follow this [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) to create the service account. Take note of the service account address; it will look like this: `name-of-the-sa@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
  - Follow this [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating) to download the key JSON file with the service account credentials.  
  - Rename the JSON file to `credentials.json` and copy it under [/app](/app) folder.
  - [Optional] If your file has a different name and/or you copied it to a different location, change line 27 in [app_config.toml](/app/app_config.toml) to reflect these changes.
 - When you deploy the app to AppEngine, the JSON file will be copied inside the docker image.
 - **IMPORTANT**: For security reasons, DON'T push this credentials to a public Github repository.

### Google Drive
 - Navigate to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and create a folder.  
   - This folder will be used to host the templates and assets created in the demo.
 - Share this folder with the service account address you created in the previous step. Give "Editor" rights to the service account. The share will look like this:
![Share Drive](/app/images/workspace-drive.png "Share Drive")
 - Take note of the folder ID. Go into the folder you created and you will be able to find the ID in the URL. The URL will look like this:
 ![Drive ID](/app/images/workspace-drive0.png)
 - Open the configuration file [app_config.toml - line 558](/app/app_config.toml) and change to your folder ID.
 - **IMPORTANT**: Also share this folder with people who will be using the code.

## How to Deploy the APIs to Google Cloud Run

Using the same Vertex AI managed notebook you created in this [README](../README.md) file, follow the steps below:
 - Open the JupyterLab environment
 - Create a new terminal
 - Navigate to the `backend_apis` folder

> cd ./genai-for-marketing/backend_apis 

 - Open the file [config.toml](./app/config.toml), change the variables below and save it:
   - project_id
   - location
   - vertexai_search_datastore
   - drive_folder_id
   - slides_template_id
   - doc_template_id
   - sheet_template_id
   - slide_page_id_list

You will find detailed intructions in this [README](../README.md) file, specially for the workspace integration.  

 - Copy the Service Account to interact with Workspace inside the folder [backend_apis/app](./app/) and rename it to `credentials.json`.

 - Build the docker image:

> gcloud builds submit --region=us-central1 --tag gcr.io/**"YOUR PROJECT ID"**/genai-marketing-apis  

 - Deploy the container to Cloud Run:

> gcloud run deploy genai-marketing-apis --image gcr.io/**"YOUR PROJECT ID"**/genai-marketing-apis --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1  

Replace **"YOUR PROJECT ID"** with the id of your project.   
This is just one example on how to deploy this container to Cloud Run on an endpoint that accepts unauthenticated requests. Change to your requirements.

> [!CAUTION]
The templates files must be named exactly like this:

- [data source] GenAI for Marketing.xlsx
- [template] Gen AI for Marketing Google Doc Template.docx
- [template] Marketing Assets.pptx

Respect spaces in the file names. Those are hard cabled in the script:
- `infra/scripts/create_gdrive_folder.py`
